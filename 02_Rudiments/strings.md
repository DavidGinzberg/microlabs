# Strings microlabs

Using the `.length` property and `.charAt()` method of the String class,
write a method that returns the middle character in the given string.

Use the `.indexOf()` method to find the first space in a string and `.substring()` to return the first word.

Use the same behavior to find the second word in a given string.

Create a method that uses the above methods to return a string consisting of the second and first words (in reversed order) from the string given.
