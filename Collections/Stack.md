# Stack Microlab

A stack is a data structure that stores a list of elements. Each element is added with the `push(element)` method and the most recent element can be retreived with the `pop()` method. The `peek()` method returns the top element on the stack without removing it from the stack. The **last** element put **in** the stack is the **first** one to come **out** -- this is why it's called a **Last In First Out** (LIFO) data structure.

Create your own Stack for Strings called `StringStack` and implement these three methods.
